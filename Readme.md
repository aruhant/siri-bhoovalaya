# The Siri Bhoovalaya Project

Siri Bhoovalaya is a unique ancient Jain manuscript composed entirely in a numerical script. These numbers correspond to syllables across 718 languages, integrating knowledge from multiple sciences and cultural texts. The Siri Bhoovalaya Project aims to develop a comprehensive automated decoding system with simulations, while spreading awareness through our YouTube course:

## Cleaned-Up Chakras (Coming Soon)
We are in the process of providing cleaned versions of the initial Chakras from the first chapter.  
- **Current Progress**: 80 Chakras (to be added soon).  
- **Format**: Available as spreadsheets, including transposed versions for easier analysis.

---

## Chakra Bandha and Navmank Bandha (Coming Soon)
- These two Bandhas are sufficient to decode the entirety of the first volume (Khand).  
- **Output**: Applying these Bandhas reveals Kannada text. Extracting additional languages requires further steps detailed below.  
- **Implementation**: C++ algorithms.  
- **Try It**: Simulations to run these algorithms locally (planned).

---

## Decoding Multiple Languages (Coming Soon)
- From the resultant Kannada text, specific predefined patterns allow extraction of other languages, including Prakrit, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, and more.  
- **Current Work**: Algorithm implementation for multilingual decoding.  
- **Next Steps**: Simulations to demonstrate these processes (planned).

## Partitioning a Sequence of Characters into Words  
This is one of the most complex challenges. Word lists for ancient languages or historical forms of modern languages are scarce. Additionally:  
- Collaboration with language experts may be necessary to leverage grammatical constructs for better optimization.  
- Procuring literature from the era, especially digitized texts with selectable content, is ongoing to support this effort.

### Current and Planned Approaches  
- **Using Basic NLP Techniques and String Processing Algorithms** (Coming Soon).  
- **Incorporating Statistical Analysis and Semantic Rules for Optimization** (Planned).

---

## Packaged Simulations (Planned)  
Creating a comprehensive decoding system with all the above features will require significant computing power.  
- **Crowdsourced Computing**: We plan to allow users to run the software locally, contributing to discoveries.  
- **Credits**: Users will be credited for every new shloka they help decode.

## One-Stop Learning Source  
We aim to provide centralized resources for all things Siri Bhoovalaya.  
- **Website**: Launching soon.  
- **YouTube Course**: [Siri Bhoovalaya Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@siri-bhoovalaya)
